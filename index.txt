  call for mechanical conservatism in design."


Since all my friends constantly nag me about it, here it finally is: My personal
blog. It's about programming language design and Nim.

In case you didn't notice, `Nim <http://nim-lang.org>`_ is the
programming language I designed and implemented in my spare time. Nim is
still in development but it's very useful already; it can compile itself and
for instance this blog has been created with Nim's documentation generator.

List of Articles
================

| `Write tracking for Nim <writetracking.html>`_
| This blog post is about Nim's novel approach to deal with immutability.

| `A new concurrency system for Nim -- part 1 <concurrency.html>`_
| In this blog post I describe the basic ideas behind Nim's new concurrency
  model.

| `A new concurrency system for Nim -- part 2 <concurrency2.html>`_
| In part 2 things get more formal. But in the end you will be rewarded by
  a nice real world example.

| `Nim and Perl <perlish.html>`_
| An article showing how Nim's metaprogramming features can even model
  Perl's features.

| `Karax <karax.html>`_
